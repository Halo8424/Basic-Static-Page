          When considering a rabbit for a pet, understand your signing up for a
          long-term commitment. While the average lifespan of a pet rabbit is,
          according to the House Rabbit Society, about eight to 14 years old,
          certain breeds of rabbits are known to live longer than others. Just
          like you may have heard about dogs, smaller rabbits
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_rabbit">dwarf</a> or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Lop">mini lops</a>
          typically live longer than the larger breeds like
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Lop">French lops</a>
          and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_Giant_rabbit"

          "By caring for an animal, children learn to consider the needs of
          others," says Animal Behaviourist
          <a href="https://www.laurav.com.au/">Laura Vissaritis</a>. "Children
          aged six and older are generally able to take responsibility and show
          empathy, making the experience much more valuable."

            They don't need much room - unlike other pets, rabbits are happy in
            their cage during the day with a little roaming-around time at
            night.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Rabbits can be very affectionate and they are generally clean, easy
            to toilet train and love to explore," says Laura.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some people who are allergic to cats and dogs find they're fine (and
            sniffle-free) around bunnies.
          </li>
          <li>
            They're quieter than an elevator full of strangers; if you live in
            apartment where noise is a problem, a rabbit could be the answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bunnies can live indoors and can even be taught to use a litter tray
            (although if you plan to keep them outside, a secure enclosure is
            essential to protect them from predators).
          </li>
          <li>Their droppings are relatively smell- and mess-free. Bonus.</li>

          Parents, please consider that some breeds grow quite large. Ask about
          how big the adult gets before your purchase, or consider a smaller
          breed. Male rabbits should be de-sexed to avoid territorial behavior
          and females should be spayed to prevent illnesses and accidental
          breedings. Rabbits have a need to constantly chew, their teeth never
          stop growing. It's highly recommended to have a piece of wood in their
          encloser. Always remember they're more fragile than cats or dogs, so
          when handling makes sure to be firm but gentle.
